* Executive Summary

ADTAP (Ads API Tools And Patterns) is a *read-only exploration toolkit* for
understanding and documenting Google Ads account data through the Google Ads
API v23.

** What We Do

- Explore campaign structures and hierarchies
- Review historical performance data
- Examine change history and audit trails
- Document entity relationships
- Prototype query patterns

** What We Do NOT Do

- Modify campaigns, ads, or budgets
- Automate campaign management
- Build production data pipelines

* Use Cases

** 1. Campaign History Exploration

Explore the history and evolution of campaigns without making changes.

#+begin_src sql
-- Example: View campaign performance over time
SELECT
  campaign.id,
  campaign.name,
  campaign.status,
  segments.date,
  metrics.impressions,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.cost_micros
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
ORDER BY segments.date DESC
#+end_src

** 2. Change History Auditing

Review what changes were made, when, and by whom using the Change History API.

*** Key Concepts

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------+---------|
| ChangeStatus | Track resource modification timestamps |
| ChangeEvent | Detailed change records with before/after states |

*** Example Query

#+begin_src sql
-- Example: View recent changes to campaigns
SELECT
  change_event.change_date_time,
  change_event.change_resource_type,
  change_event.change_resource_name,
  change_event.user_email,
  change_event.client_type,
  change_event.old_resource,
  change_event.new_resource
FROM change_event
WHERE change_event.change_date_time DURING LAST_7_DAYS
  AND change_event.change_resource_type = 'CAMPAIGN'
ORDER BY change_event.change_date_time DESC
#+end_src

** 3. Account Structure Analysis

Understand the hierarchy and relationships between entities.

#+begin_example
Customer (Manager Account)
├── Campaign A
│   ├── AdGroup 1
│   │   ├── Ad 1.1
│   │   └── Ad 1.2
│   └── AdGroup 2
│       └── Ad 2.1
└── Campaign B
    └── AdGroup 3
        └── Ad 3.1
#+end_example

** 4. Performance Reporting

Generate read-only reports on campaign performance.

#+begin_src sql
-- Example: Top performing campaigns by conversions
SELECT
  campaign.id,
  campaign.name,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.conversions_value,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.ctr
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
  AND campaign.status = 'ENABLED'
ORDER BY metrics.conversions DESC
LIMIT 10
#+end_src

* API Retrieval Methods

Understanding when to use each method (for exploration, not production):

| Method | Best For | Notes |
|--------+----------+-------|
| =SearchStream= | Large datasets | Streaming results, no pagination |
| =Search= | Smaller datasets | Manual pagination control |
| =Get= | Single resources | Direct ID lookup |

Reference: [[https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/videos/catalog/best-practices-1][Best Practices for Retrieving Information]]

* Exploration Workflow

#+begin_src mermaid
graph LR
    A[Identify Question] --> B[Construct GAQL Query]
    B --> C[Execute via Search/SearchStream]
    C --> D[Analyze Results]
    D --> E[Document Findings]
    E --> F{More Questions?}
    F -->|Yes| A
    F -->|No| G[Share Insights]
#+end_src

* Key Principles

1. *Read-Only*: We observe, we don't modify
2. *Exploration*: Learning and understanding, not production
3. *Documentation*: Capture patterns and relationships
4. *Safety*: No risk to live campaigns
